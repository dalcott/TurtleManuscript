FileDescriptions-FishPositioning

/Data/Raw sub folder contains one .csv file of pixel coordinates for each screen capture recorded of fish within the culvert.
Each file contains 5 rows of X and Y pixel values. The rows correspond to the following points of interest on the image:
Row 1: Top-left corner of culvert
Row 2: Top-right corner of culvert
Row 3: Bottom-left corner of culvert
Row 4: Bottom-right corner of culvert
Row 5: Approximate center-of-mass of fish.
Each file also contains the columns: Area, Mean, Min, and Max which are automically included by ImageJ software but are not relevant to this study.


/Data/Normalized sub folder contains the  "FishAndCulvertCornerCoordinates_Normalized.csv".
This is the output from "FishPositioning_SetUp_NormalizingPixelCoordinates.R" R script. 
This data table consists of the normalized pixel coordinates of the 5 points of interest recorded from each screen captured image described above.
Column definitions (unless otherwise specified, "NA" means "not applicable"):
- "Name" = name of the point of interest (e.g. "TopLeft" corner of culvert, center-of-mass of "Fish").
- "X" = normalized X-coordinate value
- "Y" = normalized Y-coordinate value
- "FileName2" = file name of image with file extension removed (i.e. ".jpg" or ".csv" is removed)
- "TurtleAvailable" = "NoTurtle" if no turtle is present in the culvert at the time of this event; "Turtle" if a turtle was present at the time of the event.
- "Species" = abbreviation for fish species that this row is measuring (RH = river herring, LMB = largemouth bass, SF = sunfish, CP = chain pickerel, YP = yellow perch)
- "Direction" = direction fish was swimming through the culvert relative to stream flow direction.
- "CatchSuccess" = whether or not turtle successfully captured the fish. "NA" if no attempt was made, 0 if unsuccessful predation attempt, 1 if successful capture.



"FishPositioning_FinalAnalyses.R" - this R script reads in the normalized pixel coordinates and performs multivariate and univariate normality tests for each fish category (i.e. river herring and non-herring/resident fish)


"FishPositioning_SetUp_NormalizingPixelCoordinates.R" - this R script reads in raw pixel coordinates from each screen capture image and normalizes
the coordinates to correct for camera tilt, camera position, relative distance of fish from camera, etc. for more appropriate comparisons.
This script creats and exports the data table in file "Data/Normalized/FishAndCulvertCornerCoordinates_Normalized.csv"


"FishPositioningPlots.R" - this R script creates Figure 1 from the manuscript which is then formatted to its final version in "Plots/FormattingFigure1.ppx"
