This repository contains the data and R code necessary to reproduce the results presented in 
"Wait and snap: Common snapping turtles prey on migratory fish at crossing culverts." by Alcott et al. 
submitted to Biology Letters for peer review.

R scripts use relative directory referencing to import and export data/figures. Therefore, it is best if this entire repository is downloaded
to a local directory of your choice, maintaining downstream organization of the sub-directories within this repository.

The analyses are split into 3 parts corresponding with different analyses presented in the manuscript:
1. Fish positioning - data and analyses for fish cross-sectional position within culverts from underwater videography.
2. Stable isotopes - data and analyses for C13 stable isotope analyses of snapping turtle blood samples, river herring muscle tissue, and aquatic vegetation
3. Video Observations - data and analyses for quantifying the frequency of various behaviors that were reported from underwater videography

More detailed information provided within each folder.
