FileDescriptions_StableIsotopes

"IsotopeAnalyses.R" - this R script performs all of the analyses of stable isotope data presented in the manuscript. It also generates Figure 2 in the manuscript

"SampleIDs.csv" - this data table provides detailed biological information for each Sample ID number for each sample analyzed for C13 values.
column definitions:
"SampleID" - sample ID number
"SpeciesName" - Species name
"CommonName" - common name of organism sampled
"Taxa" - a grouping name for samples from similar taxa
"Tisse" - tissue collected from the specimen analyzed for C13 stable isotope analysis ("RBC" = red blood cell).
"WaterbodyType" - type of waterbody that the specimen was collected from (i.e. a landlocked pond or somewhere with the Herring River system connected to the sea)
"Location" - specific location that sample was collected from.
"Comments" - comments regarding the sample.
"CollectionDate" - Date sample was collected yyyy-mm-dd
"PIT" - Passive Integrated Transponder telemetry tag ID number (for snapping turtles that were tagged).
"Type" - grouping variable
"Type2" - another grouping variable


"StableIsotopeResults.xlsx" - C13 values for each Sample ID number.


"CulvertTurtlesIDs.csv" - PIT tag ID numbers for those turtles that were detected occupying a culvert. 
These individuals were classified as "culvert turtles"
